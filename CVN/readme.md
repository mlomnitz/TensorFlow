# Convolutional neural network
This directory contains the implementation for a convolutional nerual network(CVN) to classify images. CVN's will allow the model to identify patterns independent of their location in the image.

* _tf_CVN.py_ : Implementaion of the model itself using a single hidden layer and two convolutions.
* _run_CVN.py_ : Program to train the model and test the predictions using the validation dataset.
